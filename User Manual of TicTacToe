java TicTacToe User Manual And Game Play Demo
Playing the Game:

The game will display the current state of the board, which initially looks like this:
Current board:
      |   |  
-------------
      |   |  
-------------
      |   |  


The players will take turns entering their moves. Each player will be prompted to enter the row and column where they want to place their mark ('X' or 'O').
The rows and columns are zero-indexed, meaning:

•	Row 0, Column 0 is the top-left corner.
•	Row 0, Column 1 is the top-middle.
•	Row 0, Column 2 is the top-right corner.
•	Row 1, Column 0 is the middle-left.
•	Row 1, Column 1 is the center.
•	Row 1, Column 2 is the middle-right.
•	Row 2, Column 0 is the bottom-left.
•	Row 2, Column 1 is the bottom-middle.
•	Row 2, Column 2 is the bottom-right.

For example, if player 'X' wants to place their mark in the center of the board, they would enter:
1 
1

If a player tries to place a mark in an already occupied space or outside the valid range (0-2), they will receive a message indicating that the move is invalid, and they will be prompted to enter their move again.

Winning the Game:

The game will automatically check for a win after each move. If a player wins, the game will display a message like:
Player X wins!

If the board is full and no player has won, the game will display:

The game is a draw!

End of the Game:
After a win or a draw, the game will end. You can re-run the program to play again.

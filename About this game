Introduction
The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player game that serves as an excellent introduction to programming concepts, game design, and user interaction. This project aims to develop a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java. The game will allow two players to compete against each other in a 3x3 grid, aiming to place three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row before their opponent.
The project will demonstrate key programming concepts such as abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Additionally, it will provide a platform for users to engage in strategic gameplay while enhancing their problem-solving skills.

Conclusion
The Tic-Tac-Toe project aims to create an engaging and interactive game that not only entertains users but also serves as a practical application of Object-Oriented Programming principles. By implementing abstraction, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, the project will provide valuable insights into software design and development practices.
Upon completion, this project will serve as a foundational example for further exploration of game development and programming concepts. The successful implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game will demonstrate the ability to create a user-friendly application while adhering to best practices in software engineering.
